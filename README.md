A quick demo of a working first-person shooter I developed in Unreal Engine with C++, featuring a fast-paced gameplay style that keeps the player on edge. This prototype consists of enemy AI, a simple HUD that displays the player's Health/Magic gauges, and Health recovery packs scattered throughout the stage.

Enjoy!
